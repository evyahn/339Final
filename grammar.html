        <h1>Grammar Pet Peeves</h1>
        <p>For fun, let's test your knowledge!</p>
        <p>Which of these statements is correct?</p>
        <ol type="A">
            <li>Mark caught less fish than Peter.</li>
            <li>Me and Suzy went to the store last week.</li>
            <li>Johnny asked Jeffery if he did good on the exam.</li>
            <li>Taylor had a feeling she would loose to Ellen.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is a trick question There are no correct answers.</p>
        <p>A is incorrect. While less is used to describe uncountable nouns. The correct word to use in this case would be fewer. This is a very common mistake, so a lot of people make it without noticing. However, once you realize it, it is very easy to spot. This is also applicable to much and many; Much is for uncountable nouns and many is for countable noun. Because fish is a countable noun, "Mark caught fewer fish than Peter" would be correct.</p>
        <p>B is also a very common mistake, but it occurs most frequently when speaking. I is a subject pronoun while me is an object pronoun, so when the action is being done, you need to use I. The easy way to think about this is to get rid of the other person in the sentence. "Me went to the store last week" does not make sense but "I went to the store last week" makes sense, so you would need to say "Suzy and I went to the store last week".</p>
        <p>C looks correct at first, but we need to look into the differences between the words good and well. The general rule of thumb is that good is an adjective and well is an adverb. In this case. because you are modifying the verb "to do" in this sentence, you would need to say "Johnny asked Jeffery if he did well on the exam".</p>
        <p>D's issue is the word "loose". When you have not won against someone, the correct word to use is "lose". Loose is when something is not tight, so the correct sentence would be "Taylor had a feeling she would lose to Ellen".</p>
